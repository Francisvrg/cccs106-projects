# Lab 2 Report: Git Version Control and Flet GUI Development

**Student Name:** Francisco S. Verga III
**Student ID:** 231004033
**Section:** BSCS-3B
**Date:** September 10 2025

## Git Configuration

### Repository Setup
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Francisvrg/cccs106-projects
- **Local Repository:** ✅ Initialized and connected
- **Commit History:** 8 commits with descriptive messages

### Git Skills Demonstrated
- ✅ Repository initialization and configuration
- ✅ Adding, committing, and pushing changes
- ✅ Branch creation and merging
- ✅ Remote repository management

## Flet GUI Applications

### 1. hello_flet.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Interactive greeting, student info display, dialog boxes
- **UI Components:** Text, TextField, Buttons, Dialog, Containers
- **Notes:** As an observation, once the setup was complete, Flet provided an easy and inituitive way to build UI applications in python, and the Hello_Flet example ran smoothly.

### 2. personal_info_gui.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Form inputs, dropdowns, radio buttons, profile generation
- **UI Components:** TextField, Dropdown, RadioGroup, Containers, Scrolling
- **Error Handling:** Input validation and user feedback
- **Notes:** It was also challenging to familiarize with the event-driven nature of Flet, where button clicks must be connected to functions that process or display the input. An observation is that once these concepts were understood, Flet made it relatively simple to build interactive forms with minimal code.

## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions

One difficulty I encountered was arranging the input fields neatly on the interface because the default layout often caused misalignment. I encountered issues with addressing the correct folder path when saving and accessing project files in VS Code, which sometimes caused errors in running the program. I solved this by setting the working directory properly and making sure the script was executed from the correct project folder. Through these adjustments, the GUI became more user-friendly and responsive.

## Learning Outcomes

From this activity, I learned the importance of version control in keeping track of code changes, avoiding conflicts, and safely experimenting with new features using tools like Git. In GUI development, I gained a better understanding of how layout management, event handling, and input validation work together to create a functional and user-friendly interface.

### Git Repository
- ✅ GitHub repository with commit history
- ✅ Local git log showing commits

### GUI Applications
- ✅ hello_flet.py running with all features
- ✅ personal_info_gui.py with filled form and generated profile

## Future Enhancements

To improve the Personal Information GUI application, one idea is to enhance the interface by adding more structured layouts, such as tabs or sections, to better organize the information fields. Input validation can also be improved by providing error messages or visual indicators when incorrect data is entered.
